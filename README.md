# Global-Suicide-Trends-Dashboard-Excel-
Analyzed suicide statistics from 2001–2012 to uncover demographic and regional patterns. Built an interactive Excel dashboard with pivot tables, charts, and KPIs to track trends by age, gender, and country.
This project investigates suicide data spanning 2001–2012 to identify global and demographic trends. The dataset was cleaned and organized in Excel, and insights were visualized using pivot tables, charts, and slicers.

The dashboard highlights:

Yearly suicide trends, identifying increases or decreases over time.

Demographic breakdowns, including gender and age groups most affected.

Regional patterns, comparing suicide rates across different countries.

KPI tracking, such as total suicides, average annual change, and highest-risk demographic groups.

By combining Excel analytics with data storytelling, this project demonstrates my ability to translate sensitive public health data into actionable insights. It reflects strong skills in data cleaning, visualization, and analytical reporting — while also showing sensitivity in handling complex social issues.
